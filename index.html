    <h1>Interaction Plot Generator</h1>
    <p class="frontmatter">
      This tool can be used to draw an interaction plot from a regression model.
      It is in no way a replacement for tools such as Stata's
      <a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals/rmargins.pdf"><code>margins</code></a>/
      <a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals/rmarginsplot.pdf"><code>marginsplot</code></a>
      or any of the various R packages (e.g.
      <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=emmeans"><strong>emmeans</strong></a>,
      <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=interactions"><strong>interactions</strong></a>,
      or <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=marginaleffects"><strong>marginaleffects</strong></a>),
      but may be useful if using software that does not support easy generation
      of such plots.
    </p>
    <p class="frontmatter">
      Currently this tool supports only continuous/continuous interactions (or
      binary, if you code it as 0/1), and only linear regression models. I hope
      to add support for categorical interactions as well as non-linear models.

            <p>
              If your model has no additional covariates, you can use the
              intercept/constant reported from the model as the <strong>Intercept</strong>.
              However, if you have covariates, you likely want to use an
              intercept at some "average" value of those covariates. One way to
              obtain this is to center (at their mean, or some specific
              meaningful value) each of the other covariates, then use the
              reported intercept/constant.
              <br><br>
              Alternatively, you can manually compute an intercept. Say your
              model has a single other predictor <strong>Z</strong>. Let <strong>Z*</strong>
              represent some "average" value of <strong>Z</strong> (again, this
              can be the actual mean, or a representative value; if <strong>Z</strong>
              was IQ, perhaps <strong>Z*</strong> being 100 would make sense,
              regardless of the actual sample mean of <strong>Z</strong>).
              Let &alpha; be the reported intercept, and let &beta; be the
              estimated coefficient on <strong>Z</strong>. You would then use
              &alpha; + &beta;<strong>Z*</strong> as the <strong>Intercept</strong>.

            Enter at least 2 values for <strong>X</strong>. Only two points are
            required to draw a line in the linear case, though more can be added
            if desired.

          <p>
            For each value of the moderator here, a separate line will be drawn.
            You can enter values such as the mean and +/- 1 standard deviation,
            or you can choose several meaningful values (e.g. if the moderator
            is age, perhaps 21, 40 and 65 as legal age, middle age, retirement
            age). Adding too many values will make the plot very messy.
